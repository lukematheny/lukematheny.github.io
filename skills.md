### Career Trajectory

#### Short-term:
- Abiding by all I believe in (from [Home Page](index.md)), I aim early in my career to be involved with not only electrical engineering but mechanical and manufacturing engineering as well. Working on hardware helps me get there.
- Graduating Fall of 2025, I plan to have two more internships before then, one for each Summer.

#### Long-term:
- I aim to learn more about esoteric manufacturing techniques, especially those involving semiconductor manufacturing.
- I'd be disappointed in myself if I didn't have several-year stints at both manufacturing companies and microgrid companies.

#### How I'm getting there
1. Reaching out more to network with people interested in hardware and energy in my space.
2. Joining an energy systems engineering lab (Spring 2024).
3. Being more active at career fairs and events.
