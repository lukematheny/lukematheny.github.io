### Career Trajectory

- Abiding by all I believe in (from [Home Page](index.md)), I aim early in my career to be involved with not only electrical engineering but mechanical and manufacturing engineering as well. Working on hardware helps me get there.
- I aim to learn more about esoteric manufacturing techniques, especially those involving semiconductor manufacturing.
- Graduating Fall of 2025, I plan to have two more internships before then, one for each Summer.

#### How I'm getting there
1. Reaching out more to network with people interested in hardware and energy in my space.
2. Joining an energy systems engineering lab (Spring 2024).
3.
