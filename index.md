I'm a 3rd year Electrical Engineering student at Georgia Tech.  
Check out this website to get to know me and how I could take part in your engineering team!

### Some things about me
- I'm interested in everything to do with energy. I am president of the GT Energy Club and have done battery research in materials science before.
- Materials Science is my undergraduate minor.
- I love building electronic hardware.
- I grew up in Wake Forest, North Carolina.
- I'm pursuing energy systems and circuit technology threads in my ECE major.

### Some things I believe
1.	People should build things.
2.	The ideal builder should have mastery of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and manufacturing. The best engineers understand the full vertical stack of whatever they build.
3.	Everyone should do a lot more to improve their taste and curate their information intake according to it.
4.	Builders and artists should make what they think is cool. An artist’s own taste is far more potent for creating great art than an artist’s assumption of the taste of others.
5.	The best next-action for a builder is usually obvious in some way. Seeing it requires taste and an open mind, not more data points. More often than not, data tells the decision-maker a hundred different wrong stories.
6.	Increasing the amount of meaningful marginal wealth for the greatest number of people is the most important trajectory of civilization.
7.	Improvement of manufacturing is core to increasing the wealth of the most people. On average, working with atoms is far more important than working with bits.
8.	The industrial age is in its infancy.
9.	We should decrease the activation energy to invent things and increase the engineering expertise of as many people as possible. Both are important in maximizing innovation and accelerating the trajectory of civilization, but the first is not appreciated enough.
10.	Increasing energy use is good and correlates very well with human prosperity. Energy is the soul of manufacturing, and manufacturing is the soul of innovation.
11.	Solar power, because of its decentralized nature and lack of fuel, is able to unlock immense energy abundance. Our current power grid prevents it from doing so.
12.	Nuclear power is the best long-term centralized complement to solar power, and we will need both.
13.	The long-term equilibrium of electric power distribution is far from our existing centralized grid. Utilities will not find this equilibrium on their own, and we must weaken utility monopolies to achieve it.
14.	It is possible and favorable to create extreme abundance of material goods and wealth for everyone on earth. Innovation, manufacturing, and policy all must be leveraged quickly to get there faster.
15.	Everyone can do more than they think they can. Our limits are self-imposed.

### Summary
I set high goals for myself, and I love to build cool things. I focus on building good taste of what to build so that I can be truly satisfied with the things I make. The passion that drives me originates in building truly sustainable and efficient things and places, looking to the core of the problems so I can know where to make the most impact. Further, 2023 has been the greatest year for me in terms of developing as and engineer and as a communicator/leader. I've been the president of the GT Energy Club since January, organized the club's Energy Conference for this year, recruited team members to work on various projects, and worked in my first internship over the Summer.
